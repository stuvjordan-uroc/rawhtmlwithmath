How do I include math in a raw html?

I need some custom styling for my tables, and thus am using raw html in raw html blocks for tables.

How do I get latex markup in that raw html render via whichever math rendering engine I'm using for my project?

In this repo, I've tried delimiting latex markup with `\( \)` but that does not seem to do the trick.
